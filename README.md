# Simple-Compiler-Prototype
Program2.cpp was a previous version of the simple compiler program. It utilizes a state table and an action table to convert text input into tokens that a second program would be able to easily convert into machine language.
StateTableGenerator.cpp and ActionTableGenerator.cpp were used to quickly and accurately generate the state tables that I then copied directly into the program.
